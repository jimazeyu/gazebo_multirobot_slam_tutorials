# gazebo_tutorials

#### Introduction
This is a relatively comprehensive tutorial. It will be divided into four articles covering four topics:
- Setting up the Gazebo simulation environment and running the SLAM algorithm in a virtual environment to save the environmental map.
- Using map_merge, multiple robots perform SLAM mapping simultaneously.
- Using map_server to open the saved map, and using acml for positioning and move_base for autonomous navigation.
- Utilizing the explore_lite package to enable the robot to autonomously navigate and build maps simultaneously.
